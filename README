The PHP version is 7.1.

For reading the Excel file, I'm using the PhpSpreadsheet library and added it by the composer.

For getting data daily, I have a 'get_price_data.php' which should run in the terminal because of the amount of data and its progress. It should be run as a cronJob.
I wrote a cron command in `backend_test\cron\cron`. It should be set up on the server.
I run it on Windows. So I added a bat file with the PHP run command to the Task Scheduler of Windows and set it to run once a day.
The bat file is 'backend_test\cron\cron_bat'.

Database and table structure is in 'backend_test\files\prices.sql'
